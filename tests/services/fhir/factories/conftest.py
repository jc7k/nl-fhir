"""
Factory tests configuration and shared fixtures.

PHASE 1 SKIP: All factory tests are skipped due to missing resource_factory.py module.
This is a pre-existing brownfield issue that requires architectural refactoring.

Root Cause:
- src/nl_fhir/services/fhir/resource_factory.py does not exist
- factories/__init__.py line 349: `from ..resource_factory import FHIRResourceFactory`
- Import always fails â†’ fallback to MockResourceFactory
- 38 tests expect real factory behavior, fail when mock is returned

See GitHub Issue #42 for tracking and resolution plan.
