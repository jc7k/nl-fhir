# NL-FHIR Task Completion Criteria

## Pre-Implementation Phase (Current)
Since no code exists yet, completion criteria focus on planning and setup:

### Planning Tasks
- [ ] Archon task status updated to "review" or "done"
- [ ] Implementation follows researched best practices from RAG queries
- [ ] Code examples reviewed and patterns identified
- [ ] Security considerations documented (HIPAA compliance)
- [ ] Integration points with existing PRD documented

### Research Tasks  
- [ ] `archon:perform_rag_query()` completed for relevant patterns
- [ ] `archon:search_code_examples()` completed for implementation guidance
- [ ] Cross-validation of multiple sources completed
- [ ] Assumptions and limitations documented

## Future Implementation Phase
When coding begins, these additional criteria apply:

### Code Implementation
- [ ] FHIR validation success rate â‰¥95% on test datasets
- [ ] API response times <2s (per MVP success metrics)
- [ ] No PHI exposure in logs or error messages
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with HAPI FHIR validation
- [ ] Golden dataset regression testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] HIPAA compliance verified (surrogate IDs only)
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ encryption for all communications
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization implemented
- [ ] Audit logging without PHI implemented

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation updated (FastAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Architectural decision records created if needed
- [ ] User stories acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Integration guides updated for downstream consumers
