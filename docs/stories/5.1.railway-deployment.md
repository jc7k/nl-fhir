### Docker Configuration Strategy
**Production-Optimized Containerization**:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage Dockerfile for production optimization
FROM python:3.11-slim as base
# Install system dependencies and security updates
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

FROM base as dependencies
# Install Python dependencies with caching optimization
COPY requirements/ requirements/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements/production.txt

FROM base as production
# Copy application code and dependencies
COPY --from=dependencies /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY src/ /app/src/
COPY static/ /app/static/
COPY templates/ /app/templates/

# Security and performance optimization
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser
USER appuser
EXPOSE 8000

# Health check and startup command
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--workers", "4"]
```

### Railway Environment Configuration
**Environment-Specific Settings**:
```python
# Railway environment configuration
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENTS = {
    'development': {
        'NLP_MODEL_SIZE': 'small',
        'CHROMADB_PERSISTENCE': 'memory',
        'HAPI_FHIR_ENDPOINT': 'http://localhost:8080/fhir',
        'LOG_LEVEL': 'DEBUG',
        'WORKERS': 1
    },
    'staging': {
        'NLP_MODEL_SIZE': 'medium',
        'CHROMADB_PERSISTENCE': 'disk',
        'HAPI_FHIR_ENDPOINT': 'https://staging-hapi.example.com/fhir',
        'LOG_LEVEL': 'INFO',
        'WORKERS': 2
    },
    'production': {
        'NLP_MODEL_SIZE': 'large',
        'CHROMADB_PERSISTENCE': 'distributed',
        'HAPI_FHIR_ENDPOINT': 'https://hapi.example.com/fhir',
        'LOG_LEVEL': 'WARNING',
        'WORKERS': 4
    }
}
```

- **Monitoring Keys**: Application performance monitoring credentials

### Service Resource Optimization
**Railway Resource Allocation**:
```yaml
# Railway service configuration
services:
  nl-fhir-api:
    plan: "Pro"  # Optimized for production workloads
    memory: "2GB"  # Sufficient for NLP models and processing
    cpu: "2 vCPU"  # Balanced for concurrent request processing
    storage: "10GB"  # Application code and temporary files
    
  chromadb:
    plan: "Standard"
    memory: "4GB"  # Vector database memory requirements
    storage: "50GB"  # Medical terminology embeddings and indices
    
  postgresql:
    plan: "Standard"
    memory: "1GB"  # Application database requirements
    storage: "20GB"  # Data storage with room for growth
```
