### Epic 4 Integration Interface Design
**Epic 3 → Epic 4 Data Contract**:
```python

    request_id: str
    processing_metadata: ProcessingMetadata
    nlp_results: NLPProcessingResult  # Epic 2 output
    fhir_resources: List[FHIRResource]  # Story 3.1 output
    fhir_bundle: FHIRBundle  # Story 3.2 output  
    validation_results: ValidationResults  # Story 3.3 output
    quality_metrics: QualityMetrics
    bundle_summary_data: BundleSummaryData  # Epic 4 preparation
