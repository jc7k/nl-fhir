# Story 1.2: Convert Endpoint Processing Logic

## Status
**Completed** - Implementation finished and tested with 78 total tests passing

## Story
**As a** developer integrating the NL-FHIR system,  
**I want** the `/convert` endpoint to process natural language clinical orders and return a structured response format,  
**so that** the system has a foundation for future NLP integration and can provide consistent API responses to clients.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Request Processing**: `/convert` endpoint should accept and validate `{text, patientRef}` JSON payload from Story 1.1
2. **Response Structure**: Return structured JSON response with placeholder fields for future FHIR bundle integration
3. **Input Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation for text input (length limits, content sanitization, required fields)
4. **Error Handling**: Provide detailed error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes for various failure scenarios
5. **Logging Framework**: Implement secure logging that follows HIPAA compliance (no PHI in logs, use request IDs)
6. **API Documentation**: Generate automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the endpoint
7. **Response Time Baseline**: Establish baseline response time measurement for future <2s performance requirement

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Previous Story
**Story 1.1 Foundation**:
- Basic FastAPI application structure established
- Web form interface created with `/convert` endpoint stub
- Project directory structure in place
- Basic CORS and logging configuration started

### Integration Points for Future Epics
**Epic 2 - NLP Pipeline Integration**:
- Response structure includes `extracted_entities` placeholder for spaCy/medspaCy output
- Request processing foundation ready for NLP pipeline insertion
- Logging framework ready for NLP processing metrics

**Epic 3 - FHIR Bundle Assembly**:
- Response structure includes `fhir_bundle` placeholder field
- Validation framework ready for HAPI FHIR integration
- Error handling prepared for FHIR validation failures

### Technology Stack Details
**Core Dependencies** [Source: prd/7-dependencies.md]:
- **FastAPI** - Web framework with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Pydantic** - Request/response validation and serialization
- **Python logging** - Structured logging with JSON formatting

**Security Requirements** [Source: CLAUDE.md#HIPAA-Compliance]:
- **No PHI in logs** - Use surrogate identifiers and request IDs only
- **Input sanitization** - Prevent injection attacks on clinical text
- **TLS 1.2+ encryption** - All API communications (handled at deployment)
- **Audit logging** - Track all processing without exposing PHI

### Performance Requirements [Source: CLAUDE.md#Performance-Requirements]:
- **<2s API response time** - End-to-end processing requirement (establish baseline)
- **Response time measurement** - Log and monitor processing times
- **Future optimization** - Foundation for performance improvements
