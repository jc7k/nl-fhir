### Production Performance Requirements [Source: CLAUDE.md#Performance-Requirements]
**Critical Performance Targets**:
- **<2s total response time** - Complete NLP pipeline end-to-end
- **≥99.9% uptime** - Production reliability with proper error recovery
- **Concurrent processing** - Handle multiple clinical orders simultaneously
- **Resource efficiency** - Optimize memory usage for NLP models and embeddings

### Multi-Component Error Recovery Strategy
**Intelligent Fallback Chains**:
- **LLM Failure** → ChromaDB RAG + spaCy entity extraction + rule-based structured output
- **ChromaDB Failure** → spaCy entity extraction + LLM processing + terminology API fallback  
- **spaCy Model Failure** → LLM-only processing with medical prompt engineering
- **Complete NLP Failure** → Rule-based extraction with manual review flagging

### Security and HIPAA Production Requirements
**Production Security Framework**:
- **PHI Anonymization** - Production-grade clinical text anonymization before processing
- **Audit Trails** - Complete HIPAA-compliant logging for all NLP processing
- **Secure Communications** - TLS 1.2+ for all inter-service communications
- **API Security** - Secure credential management and API key rotation
- **Access Controls** - Role-based access for NLP pipeline administration

### Epic 3 Integration Interface Design
**Standardized NLP Output Format**:
```python
class NLPProcessingResult(BaseModel):
    request_id: str
    processing_metadata: ProcessingMetadata
    extracted_entities: List[ExtractedEntity]  # Story 2.1 output
    enhanced_terminology: List[EnhancedEntity]  # Story 2.2 output  
    structured_medical_data: StructuredMedicalData  # Story 2.3 output
    confidence_scores: ConfidenceScores
    processing_performance: PerformanceMetrics
    fhir_ready_data: FHIRReadyData  # Epic 3 preparation
```

### Production Monitoring Strategy
**NLP-Specific Metrics**:
- **Processing Performance**: Response times per NLP stage
- **Medical Quality Metrics**: Entity extraction accuracy, terminology coverage
- **Cost Metrics**: LLM API usage, ChromaDB query costs
- **Error Rates**: Component failure rates, fallback usage frequency
