# Story 2.2: RAG Integration & Medical Terminology Lookup

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** clinical NLP system processing medical orders,  
**I want** to integrate ChromaDB for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance medical terminology recognition and standardization,  
**so that** extracted medical entities from Story 2.1 can be validated, normalized, and mapped to standard medical terminologies (RxNorm, LOINC, ICD-10) for accurate FHIR resource creation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **ChromaDB Integration**: Install and configure ChromaDB for storing and querying medical terminology embeddings
2. **Medical Knowledge Base**: Create and populate vector database with standard medical terminologies (medications, procedures, conditions)
3. **Entity Enhancement Pipeline**: Integrate RAG lookup into NLP pipeline to enhance and validate extracted entities from Story 2.1
4. **Terminology Standardization**: Map extracted entities to standardized medical codes (RxNorm for medications, LOINC for labs, ICD-10 for conditions)
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Implement confidence scoring for terminology matches with fallback strategies
6. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure RAG processing maintains <2s total response time requirement
7. **Medical Code Validation**: Validate and enrich entities with proper medical coding for FHIR compliance

## Dev Notes

### Integration with Story 2.1 Foundation
**NLP Pipeline Enhancement**:
- Build upon existing spaCy/medspaCy entity extraction from Story 2.1
- Enhance extracted entities with standardized medical terminology
- Preserve existing entity extraction while adding RAG enrichment
- Maintain performance requirements and error handling framework

### Medical Terminology Requirements [Source: CLAUDE.md#Technical-Specifications]
**Standard Medical Terminologies**:
- **RxNorm** - Medication names and codes for MedicationRequest resources
- **LOINC** - Laboratory test codes for ServiceRequest and Observation resources  
- **ICD-10** - Condition codes for Condition resources
- **FHIR ValueSets** - Standard terminology binding for FHIR resources

### Technology Stack Integration [Source: prd/7-dependencies.md]
**RAG Technology Stack**:
- **ChromaDB** - Vector database for medical terminology storage and retrieval
- **Sentence Transformers** - Biomedical embedding models (e.g., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT)
- **FHIR Terminology Services** - Integration with FHIR-compliant terminology servers

### Performance and Security Considerations
**Performance Requirements** [Source: CLAUDE.md#Performance-Requirements]:
- **<2s total response time** - Including NLP + RAG processing
- **Efficient vector search** - Optimize ChromaDB queries for medical terminology
- **Caching strategy** - Reduce repeated terminology lookups

**HIPAA Compliance**:
- **No PHI in vector database** - Store only standard terminology, not patient data
- **Secure terminology lookup** - Log terminology queries without exposing clinical content
- **Audit medical code assignments** - Track entity → code mappings for compliance

  - Strength: "500 MG"
  - FHIR CodeableConcept: Ready for MedicationRequest

Original Entity: "CBC"  
RAG Enhanced:
  - LOINC Code: 58410-2
  - Display: "CBC panel - Blood by Automated count"
  - FHIR CodeableConcept: Ready for ServiceRequest
```

### Testing Strategy
**RAG-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- **Terminology Accuracy**: Validate medical code mappings against known standards
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure RAG processing meets <2s total requirement
- **Medical Domain Validation**: Test with clinical terminology variations

- **Confidence Threshold Testing**: Validate scoring and fallback mechanisms

**Clinical Terminology Test Cases**:
```
"Start metformin 850mg daily" → RxNorm mapping validation
"Order comprehensive metabolic panel" → LOINC code lookup  
"Evaluate for diabetes mellitus" → ICD-10 condition mapping
"Schedule chest X-ray" → Procedure code enhancement
```

### Future Epic Integration
