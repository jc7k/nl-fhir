# User Story IW-005: End-to-End Infusion Workflow Integration

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** IW-005
**Epic:** Epic-IW-001 (Infusion Workflow FHIR Resource Support)
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** Sprint 3

## User Story
**As a** clinical user managing complete infusion therapy workflows
**I want** the system to generate comprehensive FHIR bundles that link orders, administration, devices, and monitoring data
**So that** I have complete end-to-end traceability and documentation for infusion therapy

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Complete Workflow Bundle Generation
**Given** clinical text describing a complete infusion scenario
**When** the system processes the narrative
**Then** a comprehensive FHIR bundle is created containing:
- [ ] Patient resource (demographics)
- [ ] Practitioner resource (ordering/administering provider)
- [ ] MedicationRequest resource (original order)
- [ ] MedicationAdministration resource (actual administration)
- [ ] Device resource (infusion equipment)
- [ ] DeviceUseStatement resource (patient-device linking)
- [ ] Observation resources (monitoring data)
- [ ] Encounter resource (clinical context)

### AC2: Resource Relationship Integrity
**Given** a complete infusion workflow bundle
**When** examining resource relationships
**Then** all resources are properly linked:
- [ ] MedicationAdministration references MedicationRequest
- [ ] DeviceUseStatement links Patient and Device
- [ ] Observations reference Patient and Encounter
- [ ] All resources reference correct Patient
- [ ] Bundle maintains referential integrity

### AC3: Complex Scenario Support
**Given** clinical text describing complex infusion scenarios
**When** processing multi-step workflows
**Then** the system handles:
- [ ] Multiple medications via single device
- [ ] Multiple devices for single patient
- [ ] Sequential administrations over time
- [ ] Medication changes or dose adjustments
- [ ] Adverse reactions and interventions

### AC4: Bundle Validation Excellence
**Given** any generated complete workflow bundle
**When** validated against HAPI FHIR server
**Then** validation achieves:
- [ ] 100% validation success rate
- [ ] No referential integrity errors
- [ ] Proper resource versioning
- [ ] Correct bundle type (transaction)

### AC5: Performance Requirements
**Given** complex infusion workflow processing
**When** generating complete bundles
**Then** performance meets requirements:
- [ ] <2s total response time for complete workflow
- [ ] Efficient resource creation and linking
- [ ] Optimized bundle assembly
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits

## Technical Requirements

### Enhanced NLP Pipeline
- **Comprehensive extraction:** All infusion workflow elements in single pass
- **Relationship detection:** Cross-resource relationships and dependencies
- **Temporal sequencing:** Order of events and timing relationships
- **Context awareness:** Clinical setting and patient condition

### Bundle Assembly Enhancement
```python
def create_complete_infusion_bundle(
    self,
    clinical_text: str,
    patient_ref: Optional[str] = None,
    request_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### Resource Orchestration
- **Dependency management:** Create resources in proper order
- **Reference resolution:** Ensure all references are valid
- **Transaction integrity:** All-or-nothing bundle creation
- **Error handling:** Graceful degradation on partial failures

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete IV Morphine Workflow
**Input:** "Patient Emma Garcia admitted to ICU, Dr. Smith ordered morphine 4mg IV every 4 hours for post-operative pain. Nurse Johnson administered first dose via IV pump at 14:30. Patient BP 110/70, HR 68, pain scale 3/10 after administration. IV site clear, no complications."

**Expected Bundle Contents:**
- Patient: Emma Garcia
- Practitioner: Dr. Smith (ordering), Nurse Johnson (administering)
- Encounter: ICU admission
- MedicationRequest: Morphine 4mg IV q4h order
- MedicationAdministration: First dose at 14:30
- Device: IV pump
- DeviceUseStatement: Emma Garcia using IV pump
- Observations: BP, HR, pain scale, IV site assessment

### Scenario 2: Complex Multi-Drug Infusion
**Input:** "Patient John Taylor in emergency department receiving epinephrine 0.3mg IM for anaphylaxis, followed by continuous normal saline infusion via IV pump. Vancomycin 1g IV started at 16:00 through same IV line. Blood pressure monitoring every 15 minutes, SpO2 continuous. Patient stable, no adverse reactions."

**Expected Bundle Contents:**
- Multiple MedicationAdministration resources (epinephrine, saline, vancomycin)
- Single Device (IV pump) with multiple DeviceUseStatement entries
- Multiple Observation resources for monitoring
- Proper temporal sequencing of events

### Scenario 3: Adverse Reaction Management
**Input:** "Patient Sarah Kim receiving vancomycin infusion developed red man syndrome. Infusion stopped immediately, diphenhydramine 25mg IV given, infusion restarted at slower rate after symptoms resolved."

**Expected Bundle Contents:**
- Original vancomycin MedicationAdministration (stopped status)
- Observation for adverse reaction
- Diphenhydramine MedicationAdministration (intervention)
- Second vancomycin MedicationAdministration (modified rate)
- Complete audit trail of interventions

## Definition of Done
