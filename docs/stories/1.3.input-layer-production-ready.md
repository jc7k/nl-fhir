# Story 1.3: Input Layer Integration & Production Readiness

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** system administrator preparing for production deployment,  
**I want** the complete Input Layer (web form + convert endpoint) to be fully integrated, tested, and production-ready,  
**so that** Epic 1 delivers a secure, performant, and reliable foundation that can handle real clinical orders while preparing for Epic 2 NLP integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **End-to-End Integration**: Complete integration between web form (Story 1.1) and convert endpoint logic (Story 1.2) with full user workflow testing
2. **Production Security**: Security hardening including rate limiting, input sanitization validation, and HIPAA compliance verification
3. **Performance Validation**: Establish and validate baseline performance metrics, ensure system meets initial performance targets
4. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation and user-friendly error presentation
5. **Monitoring & Observability**: Production-ready logging, metrics collection, and health check endpoints
6. **Deployment Preparation**: Docker configuration, environment setup, and deployment documentation for Railway hosting
7. **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI documentation with examples, ready for Epic 2 integration teams
