# Story 1.1: Web Form Input Interface

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** clinician (physician, nurse, or healthcare provider),  
**I want** a simple web form interface where I can enter natural language clinical orders,  
**so that** I can easily input orders like "Start patient John Doe on 500 mg amoxicillin twice daily" without needing to learn complex FHIR syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Web Form UI**: Create a simple web page with a textarea field for clinical text input and a submit button
2. **Input Validation**: The form should accept multi-line text input and handle basic validation (non-empty text)
3. **Patient Reference Field**: Include an optional patient reference field for linking orders to specific patients
4. **Form Submission**: Form should POST to `/convert` endpoint with `{text, patientRef}` payload structure
5. **Basic Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages for failed submissions
6. **Responsive Design**: Form should work on both desktop and mobile browsers

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Set up FastAPI project structure** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create main FastAPI application file (`main.py`)
  - [x] Set up basic project directory structure
  - [x] Configure FastAPI with CORS for web form access
  - [x] Add basic logging configuration

- [x] **Task 2: Create web form HTML interface** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 6)
  - [x] Design simple HTML form with textarea and submit button
  - [x] Add patient reference input field (optional)
  - [x] Implement responsive CSS for mobile/desktop compatibility
  - [x] Add client-side basic form validation (non-empty check)

- [x] **Task 3: Implement POST /convert endpoint stub** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create FastAPI endpoint accepting `{text, patientRef}` JSON payload
  - [x] Add request validation using Pydantic models
  - [x] Return placeholder response structure for now
  - [x] Add proper HTTP status codes and error responses

- [x] **Task 4: Add error handling and user feedback** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Implement server-side error response handling
  - [x] Add client-side JavaScript to display error messages
  - [x] Create user-friendly error message templates
  - [x] Add loading state indicators during form submission

- [x] **Task 5: Basic testing setup** (All ACs)
  - [x] Create test file structure
  - [x] Write basic endpoint tests for `/convert`
  - [x] Add form validation tests
  - [x] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from PRD
Based on functional requirements section 5.1 and dependencies section 7:

**Core Technology Stack**:
- **FastAPI** - Python web framework for backend API [Source: prd/7-dependencies.md]
- **FHIR R4** - Target output format for clinical orders [Source: prd/5-functional-requirements.md#5.3]

**Input Layer Requirements**:
- **Web form with single text field (textarea) + submit button** [Source: prd/5-functional-requirements.md#5.1]
- **RESTful POST /convert endpoint accepts {text, patientRef}** [Source: prd/5-functional-requirements.md#5.1]

**Future Integration Points**:
- This web form will connect to NLP pipeline (spaCy/medspaCy) in Epic 2
- Output will feed into FHIR bundle assembly in Epic 3
- Validation will use HAPI FHIR server integration from Epic 3

**Project Structure Notes**:
Since no architecture documents exist yet, following standard FastAPI patterns:
- `main.py` - Main FastAPI application
- `static/` - CSS/JS files for web form
- `templates/` - HTML templates
- `tests/` - Test files
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### Testing
**Testing Standards** (to be established):
- **Test file location**: `tests/` directory
- **Testing framework**: pytest (standard for FastAPI projects)
- **Test patterns**: API endpoint testing, form validation testing
- **Coverage requirements**: All endpoints and validation logic must be tested

**Specific Testing Requirements for this Story**:
- Test `/convert` endpoint with valid and invalid payloads
- Test form validation (empty text, missing fields)
- Test responsive design functionality
- Test error message display and handling
