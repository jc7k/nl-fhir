# Story 4.2: Safety Policy & Validation Framework

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** healthcare safety officer and clinical risk manager,  
**I want** comprehensive safety validation and policy enforcement for all processed clinical orders,

4. **Clinical Decision Support**: Provide evidence-based recommendations and warnings for clinical orders
5. **Safety Alert Integration**: Integrate safety warnings into bundle summaries and processing results
6. **Risk Scoring**: Assign safety risk scores to processed orders with actionable recommendations
7. **Compliance Documentation**: Generate safety validation documentation for regulatory and audit requirements

### Drug Interaction Detection Framework
**Interaction Classification System**:
```python
class DrugInteraction(BaseModel):
    drug_a: str
    drug_b: str
    severity: InteractionSeverity  # CONTRAINDICATED, MAJOR, MODERATE, MINOR
    mechanism: str
    clinical_effect: str
    management_recommendation: str
    evidence_level: str
    
class InteractionSeverity(Enum):
    CONTRAINDICATED = "contraindicated"  # Avoid combination
    MAJOR = "major"                      # Monitor closely, consider alternatives
    MODERATE = "moderate"                # Monitor for effects
    MINOR = "minor"                      # Awareness sufficient
```

### Safety Risk Scoring Algorithm
**Multi-Factor Risk Assessment**:
```python
def calculate_safety_risk_score(bundle: FHIRBundle) -> SafetyRiskScore:
    risk_factors = {
        'drug_interactions': weight_drug_interactions(bundle),
        'contraindications': weight_contraindications(bundle),
        'dosage_concerns': weight_dosage_safety(bundle),
        'monitoring_requirements': weight_monitoring_needs(bundle),
        'patient_complexity': weight_patient_factors(bundle)
    }
    
    # Risk score: 0-100 (0=minimal risk, 100=high risk)
    total_score = calculate_weighted_risk(risk_factors)
    
    return SafetyRiskScore(
        overall_score=total_score,
        risk_level=classify_risk_level(total_score),
        contributing_factors=risk_factors,
        recommendations=generate_risk_recommendations(risk_factors)
    )
```

### Clinical Decision Support Integration
**Evidence-Based Recommendations**:
- **Monitoring Requirements**: "Monitor hepatic function for metformin therapy"
- **Dosage Adjustments**: "Consider dose reduction in elderly patients (>65 years)"
- **Alternative Therapies**: "Consider alternative antibiotic due to penicillin allergy"
- **Timing Recommendations**: "Take with food to reduce gastric irritation"

### Safety Alert Integration Examples
**Enhanced Summary with Safety Information**:
```
Original Summary: "Prescribed Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes management."

Safety-Enhanced Summary: 
"Prescribed Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes management.
‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY ALERT: Monitor kidney function - contraindicated if eGFR <30
üìã MONITORING: Check baseline and annual kidney function tests
‚ÑπÔ∏è RECOMMENDATION: Take with meals to reduce gastric upset"
```
