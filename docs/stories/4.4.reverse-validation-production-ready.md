### Medical Accuracy Assurance Framework
**Multi-Layer Medical Validation**:
- **Template Validation**: Ensure template-based summaries maintain clinical accuracy
- **Safety Integration**: Validate safety information is correctly integrated and prominent
- **LLM Validation**: Comprehensive fact-checking and medical accuracy validation for LLM content
- **Cross-Component Validation**: Ensure consistency between different summary components
- **Expert Review Integration**: Clinical expert validation for complex or high-risk scenarios

### User Experience Excellence
**Role-Based Summary Optimization**:
```python
# Clinician-Focused Summary
{
  "clinical_summary": "Metformin 500mg BID for T2DM management",
  "safety_alerts": [
    {
      "level": "warning",
      "message": "Monitor renal function - contraindicated if eGFR <30",
      "action_required": "Baseline and annual creatinine assessment"
    }
  ],
  "clinical_context": "Evidence-based first-line therapy for T2DM",
  "monitoring_requirements": ["A1C q3-6mo", "Annual kidney function"],
  "enhancement_level": "contextual"
}

# Patient-Focused Summary  
{
  "patient_summary": "Your doctor prescribed Metformin to help manage your diabetes",
  "what_to_expect": "This medication helps control blood sugar levels",
  "safety_information": "Take with meals to reduce stomach upset",
  "monitoring_needed": "Blood tests to check kidney function",
  "enhancement_level": "educational"
}
```

### Production Quality Metrics
