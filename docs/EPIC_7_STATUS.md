## 📅 Recommended Timeline

### Option A: Fast Track (Aggressive)
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks total
- Weeks 1-3: Validate Goal + RelatedPerson (parallel)
- Weeks 4-6: Implement CommunicationRequest + RiskAssessment (parallel)
- Weeks 7-8: Implement ImagingStudy + integration testing

**Risk:** Higher risk of quality issues, less time for integration testing

---

### Option B: Balanced Approach (Recommended)
**Timeline:** 10-12 weeks total
- Weeks 1-3: Validate and enhance Goal + RelatedPerson
- Weeks 4-6: Implement CommunicationRequest
- Weeks 7-9: Implement RiskAssessment
- Weeks 10-12: Implement ImagingStudy + comprehensive integration testing

**Risk:** Moderate risk, good balance of speed and quality

---

### Option C: Conservative (Quality-First)
**Timeline:** 16-18 weeks total
- Weeks 1-4: Validate Goal + RelatedPerson with extensive testing
- Weeks 5-8: Implement CommunicationRequest with partner integration
- Weeks 9-12: Implement RiskAssessment with clinical validation
- Weeks 13-16: Implement ImagingStudy with DICOM partner testing
- Weeks 17-18: Full Epic 7 integration and performance testing

**Risk:** Lower risk, highest quality, enables partnership validation

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Recommended Approach:** **Option B (Balanced)** with phased value delivery

**Rationale:**
1. **75% of Epic 7 value already delivered** - No urgency to rush remaining 25%
2. **Registered resources** (Goal, RelatedPerson) can be validated quickly
3. **Remaining resources** have lower individual business impact
4. **12-week timeline** aligns with Q1 2026 target
5. **Balanced risk** approach ensures quality while maintaining momentum

**Immediate Action (Week 1):**
- Create Goal resource test suite
- Create RelatedPerson resource test suite
- Run comprehensive validation
- Update Epic 7 completion percentage to 62.5%
