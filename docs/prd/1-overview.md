# 1. Overview

This product enables clinicians to enter **unstructured natural language
doctor's orders** and automatically generate a valid **FHIR R4 Bundle**.
The bundle can be validated against a **HAPI FHIR server** and
optionally executed.

The system bridges the gap between free-text encounter notes and
structured EHR integration by combining **lightweight NLP, retrieval
grounding, structured extraction, and schema validation**.
