# Epic 5 Traceability Coverage

## Story Coverage Summary

- 5.1 Railway Deployment: FULL
- 5.2 CI/CD Automation: PARTIAL (core CI, nightly full suite; deployment automation scaffolded)
- 5.3 Monitoring/Observability: FULL (health, readiness, liveness, metrics, JSON logs)
- 5.4 Operations Runbooks: PARTIAL (scripts and docs; DR/BCP exercises pending)

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

- 5.1-1 Railway Setup → docs/operations/railway-deploy.md, railway.toml [FULL]
- 5.1-4 Docker Containerization → Dockerfile validated in CI [FULL]
- 5.2-1 GitHub Actions CI → .github/workflows/ci.yml [FULL]
- 5.2-4 Deployment Automation → deploy.sh scaffold; manual via Railway UI/CLI [PARTIAL]
- 5.3-1 Monitoring Probes → /health, /readiness, /liveness, /metrics [FULL]
- 5.3-2 JSON Logs → python-json-logger + dictConfig [FULL]
- 5.4-1 Runbooks → docs/operations/* and deployment/scripts/* [PARTIAL]

## Validation Steps for QA

1. Confirm CI jobs run as expected on a PR (build-test, tests-core, docker-build).
2. Trigger nightly or workflow_dispatch to see tests-full results.
3. Local: `make install && make dev && make smoke`.
4. After Railway deploy, run `./deployment/scripts/health-check.sh <service-url>`.
5. Verify production JSON logs with `ENVIRONMENT=production make dev`.

## Decision Context

- Deployment automation to Railway is deliberately left manual/scaffolded to avoid accidental production deploys during QA.
- DR/BCP activities are operational and will be scheduled post-QA.
