# Epic 5 QA Readiness Report

This document summarizes the implementation status of Epic 5 (Infrastructure & Deployment) and provides guidance for QA review.

## Scope
- 5.1 Railway Deployment Configuration & Cloud Infrastructure
- 5.2 CI/CD Pipeline & Automated Testing Infrastructure
- 5.3 Production Monitoring & Observability
- 5.4 Production Operations Complete (runbooks/scaffolds)

## Summary of Changes
- CI/CD
  - GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs:
    - `build-test`: Health/Readiness/Liveness/Metrics smoke checks; JSON logging verification.
    - `tests-core`: Core tests on PRs (Epic 1 endpoints and integration).
    - `tests-full`: Nightly/dispatch full suite (best‑effort, non‑blocking).
    - `docker-build`: PR‑only Dockerfile build validation with Buildx.
- Monitoring/Probes
  - New endpoints: `GET /readiness`, `GET /liveness`.
  - Existing: `GET /health`, `GET /metrics` (unchanged contract; enhanced CI coverage).
  - Structured JSON logging in production via `python-json-logger` and `settings.get_log_config()`.
- Deployment
  - Railway configuration annotated in `railway.toml`.
  - Ops docs: `docs/operations/railway-deploy.md`, `docs/operations/railway-variables-setup.md`.
  - Scripts (scaffolds): `deployment/scripts/deploy.sh`, `rollback.sh`, `health-check.sh`.
- Environment
  - `.env.example` updated to keep Epic 4 flags OFF by default in production (`SUMMARIZATION_ENABLED=false`, `SAFETY_VALIDATION_ENABLED=false`) and document `WORKERS`.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- 5.1 Railway Platform Setup & Docker: COMPLETE (docs, configs, scripts; actual deploy performed via Railway UI/CLI by ops).
- 5.2 CI/CD & Automated Testing: PARTIAL (core CI in place, nightly full test; deployment automation left to ops to wire Railway API/CLI when ready).
- 5.3 Monitoring: COMPLETE (probes, JSON logs, CI validation, docs).
- 5.4 Ops Runbooks: PARTIAL (scaffold scripts and runbook docs provided; DR/BCP exercises and tooling to be coordinated with ops).

## How QA Can Validate
1. CI Pipeline
   - Open GitHub Actions → confirm `build-test`, `tests-core`, `docker-build` run on PRs; `tests-full` on schedule/dispatch.
2. Probes
   - Local: `make install && make dev` then `make smoke`.
   - Remote: after deploy, run `./deployment/scripts/health-check.sh <service-url>`.
3. Logging
   - Locally simulate prod: `ENVIRONMENT=production LOG_LEVEL=INFO make dev` and verify JSON logs.
4. Railway Docs
   - Follow `docs/operations/railway-variables-setup.md` and `docs/operations/railway-deploy.md` for variable setup and deployment checklist.

## Risks & Notes
- No changes to Epic 4 feature paths; flags remain off by default in prod.
- Deployment automation (Railway) intentionally left manual/scaffolded to avoid accidental deploys; can be integrated later.

## Ready for QA
- Stories 5.1–5.4 are marked Ready for Review.
- Please execute the validation steps above and record results in your QA gate files.
