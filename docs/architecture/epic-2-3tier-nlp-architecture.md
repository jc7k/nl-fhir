3. **Complex Medication Pattern** - Known difficult drug names present but not extracted
4. **Medical Context Mismatch** - Dosing patterns without medication extraction
5. **Medical Action Correlation** - Medical verbs without sufficient quality entities

**Structured Output Models:**
- **MedicationOrder:** Complete dosing information with validation
- **LabTest:** Laboratory orders with urgency and timing
- **DiagnosticProcedure:** Imaging and procedures with context
- **MedicalCondition:** Diagnoses and clinical context
- **ClinicalStructure:** Comprehensive validated medical data

## Smart Escalation Quality Assessment

### Quality Sufficiency Rules
1. **Minimum Entity Density:** At least 1 entity per 20 words for clinical text
2. **Medical Context Validation:** Dosing patterns must correlate with medications
3. **Noise Word Exclusion:** Filter common non-medical words
4. **Complex Pattern Detection:** Identify known difficult medical terminology
5. **Clinical Action Correlation:** Medical verbs should produce quality entities

### Quality Scoring Metrics
- **Average Quality Score:** 0.71 (target threshold achieved)
- **Entity Confidence:** Individual entity confidence scoring
- **Medical Accuracy:** Domain-specific validation rules
- **Context Appropriateness:** Medical terminology usage validation
