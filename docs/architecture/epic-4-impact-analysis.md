# Epic 4 Adaptive Architecture Impact Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the impact of Epic 4's new **Adaptive Multi-Tier Processing Architecture** on other epics within the NL-FHIR system. The change from simple LLM-based summarization to cost-optimized, rule-based processing with LLM fallback affects multiple system components.

## Executive Summary

**Epic 4 Changes:**
- **Old Architecture:** Direct FHIR bundle ‚Üí LLM + Instructor ‚Üí Clinical summary
- **New Architecture:** FHIR bundle ‚Üí Tier 1 (Rule-based 70-80%) ‚Üí Tier 2 (Template 15-20%) ‚Üí Tier 3 (LLM 5-10%)
- **Key Benefits:** 60-80% cost reduction, deterministic processing, production monitoring, intelligent fallback

**Overall System Impact:** **LOW TO MODERATE** - Epic 4 changes are primarily self-contained with well-defined interfaces to other epics.

**Current Status:** Completed (FHIR resource creation, HAPI validation)

**Interface Dependencies:**
- Epic 3 produces validated FHIR bundles that Epic 4 consumes
- Epic 4's rule-based processing relies on Epic 3's consistent FHIR bundle structure
- HAPI validation ensures Epic 4 receives well-formed bundles for deterministic processing

**Benefits:**
- Epic 4's rule-based processing benefits from Epic 3's consistent FHIR structure
- Production monitoring in Epic 4 can track FHIR bundle complexity from Epic 3
- Cost optimization achieved through Epic 3's reliable bundle validation

**Potential Enhancements (Future Considerations):**
- Epic 3 could provide bundle complexity metadata to optimize Epic 4 tier selection
- FHIR bundle composition insights could improve Epic 4's rule-based coverage

**Required Changes:** None - current interface sufficient
