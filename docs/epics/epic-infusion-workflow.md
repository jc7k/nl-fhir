# Epic: Infusion Workflow FHIR Resource Support

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID:** Epic-IW-001
**Epic Title:** Complete Infusion Therapy FHIR Workflow Implementation
**Epic Theme:** Clinical Safety & Workflow Completeness
**Business Value:** HIGH - Enables end-to-end infusion order tracking
**Effort Estimate:** 2-3 Sprints

## Problem Statement
Currently, NL-FHIR can generate infusion orders (MedicationRequest) but cannot track:
- **Actual infusion administration events** (when IV medications are given)
- **Medical device usage** (IV pumps, infusion equipment)
- **Real-time monitoring data** during infusions

This creates a critical gap in clinical safety and workflow completeness for infusion therapy.

## Business Justification
### Current State vs. Target State

| Workflow Step | Current Support | Target Support | Business Impact |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Order Creation** | ✅ MedicationRequest | ✅ MedicationRequest | Order generation complete |
| **Administration Recording** | ❌ **Missing** | ✅ MedicationAdministration | **CRITICAL GAP** |
| **Device Integration** | ❌ **Missing** | ✅ Device + DeviceUseStatement | **CRITICAL GAP** |
| **Monitoring Data** | ❌ **Missing** | ✅ Observation | Enhanced safety |

### ROI Analysis
- **Current Coverage:** 35% of infusion workflow
- **Target Coverage:** 90% of infusion workflow
- **Resource Investment:** 2 core resources (80% value) + 2 supporting (10% value)
- **Expected Outcome:** Complete infusion therapy support

## Success Criteria
### Technical Success Metrics
- [ ] MedicationAdministration resource creation from NLP text
- [ ] Device resource support for infusion equipment
- [ ] DeviceUseStatement linking devices to patients
- [ ] Observation recording for infusion monitoring
- [ ] 100% HAPI FHIR validation for all new resources
- [ ] Integration with existing bundle assembly

### Business Success Metrics
- [ ] Support for 95%+ infusion clinical scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end traceability: Order → Administration → Device → Monitoring
- [ ] Enhanced clinical safety through complete audit trail
- [ ] Compliance with infusion therapy documentation standards

## User Personas
### Primary Users
- **ICU Nurses:** Need to document IV medication administration with device details
- **Pharmacy:** Track medication dispensing and administration completion
- **Quality Assurance:** Audit infusion therapy compliance and safety

### Secondary Users
- **Physicians:** Review infusion administration history
- **Hospital Administration:** Monitor device utilization and safety metrics
- **EHR Integration Teams:** Import complete infusion workflows

## Epic Scope
### In Scope
✅ **Core Infusion Resources**
- MedicationAdministration (administration events)
- Device (IV pumps, infusion equipment)
- DeviceUseStatement (device-patient linking)
- Observation (monitoring data during infusion)

✅ **Workflow Integration**
- NLP extraction of administration details
- Bundle assembly with linked resources
- HAPI FHIR validation for all resources

✅ **Clinical Scenarios**
- IV medication administration (existing test cases: morphine, vancomycin)
- Infusion pump usage documentation
- Continuous infusion monitoring
- Emergency medication administration

### Out of Scope
❌ **Advanced Features (Future Epics)**
- Real-time device integration APIs
- Advanced dosing calculations
- Multi-drug infusion compatibility
- Billing/financial resource integration

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- **Prerequisite:** Current FHIR resource factory architecture
- **Integration:** Existing bundle assembler patterns
- **Validation:** HAPI FHIR validation pipeline

### External Dependencies
- **Clinical Input:** Infusion therapy workflow documentation
- **Testing:** IV administration test scenarios (already available)
- **Compliance:** Hospital infusion documentation standards

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk
- **Clinical Safety:** Incorrect administration documentation could impact patient care
- **Mitigation:** Extensive validation with clinical scenarios

### Medium Risk
- **Complexity:** Device integration patterns may require new architectural patterns
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple device models, iterate based on feedback

### Low Risk
- **Performance:** Additional resources may impact bundle assembly time
- **Mitigation:** Existing architecture handles 6 resources efficiently
