# Epic 3: FHIR Bundle Assembly & Validation

## Epic Goal

Transform structured medical entities from the NLP pipeline into valid FHIR R4 bundles through systematic resource creation, assembly, and validation using HAPI FHIR servers to ensure clinical interoperability and compliance.

## Epic Description

**Business Value:**
This epic converts the extracted medical entities into industry-standard FHIR bundles that can integrate with existing EHR systems, enabling seamless clinical workflow integration and maintaining healthcare interoperability standards.

**Technical Foundation:**
- FHIR R4 resource creation for Patient, MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest, and other clinical resources
- Transaction bundle assembly with proper resource references and dependencies
- HAPI FHIR server integration for validation and execution
- Failover capabilities across multiple FHIR endpoints

**Clinical Compliance:**
All generated FHIR bundles must validate against FHIR R4 specifications and maintain clinical safety through proper resource relationships and medical coding accuracy.

## Epic Stories

### 3.1 FHIR Resource Creation
**Status:** Draft  
**Goal:** Implement FHIR R4 resource creation from NLP-extracted medical entities  
**Key Features:** Patient, MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest resource mapping, medical code integration, resource validation

### 3.2 FHIR Bundle Assembly  
**Status:** Draft  
**Goal:** Assemble individual FHIR resources into transaction bundles with proper references  
**Key Features:** Bundle creation, resource references, transaction integrity, dependency management

### 3.3 HAPI FHIR Integration
**Status:** Draft  
**Goal:** Integrate with HAPI FHIR servers for validation and execution  
**Key Features:** FHIR validation, bundle execution, failover mechanisms, endpoint management

### 3.4 FHIR Production Ready
**Status:** Draft  
**Goal:** Production optimization to achieve ≥95% validation success rate  
**Key Features:** Error handling, performance optimization, monitoring, quality assurance

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Generate valid FHIR R4 bundles with ≥95% validation success rate
- [ ] Support all common clinical order types (medications, labs, procedures)
- [ ] Maintain proper FHIR resource relationships and references
- [ ] Integrate successfully with HAPI FHIR validation endpoints
- [ ] Handle FHIR validation errors with actionable feedback
- [ ] Process bundle assembly in <500ms for typical orders
- [ ] Support transaction bundle execution with atomic operations

## Technical Architecture

**FHIR Resource Mapping:**
- **Patient Resources:** Demographics and identifiers from clinical context
- **MedicationRequest:** Prescriptions with dosage, frequency, and duration
- **ServiceRequest:** Lab orders, procedures, and diagnostic requests
- **Observation:** Clinical findings and measurements
- **Encounter:** Clinical context and visit information

**Bundle Assembly Process:**
```
Medical Entities → Resource Creation → Reference Resolution → Bundle Assembly → Validation → Transaction Bundle
```

**HAPI FHIR Integration:**
- Primary HAPI FHIR endpoint for validation and execution
- Secondary endpoints for failover and load distribution
- Validation pipeline with error classification and handling
- Bundle execution with transaction integrity

**Validation Levels:**
1. **Structural Validation:** FHIR R4 schema compliance
2. **Terminological Validation:** Medical code verification
3. **Clinical Validation:** Resource relationship consistency
4. **Business Rules:** Organization-specific constraints

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Epic 2: NLP Pipeline (provides structured medical entities)

**Provides Foundation For:**
- Epic 4: Reverse Validation (validates assembled bundles)
- Epic 5: Infrastructure (deploys FHIR assembly components)

**External Dependencies:**
- HAPI FHIR server instances (primary and failover)
- FHIR R4 specification and validation rules
- Medical terminology servers for code validation
- Transaction database for bundle state management

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risks:**
1. **FHIR Validation Failures:** Bundles failing validation due to structural or coding errors
   - **Mitigation:** Multi-stage validation, error classification, automatic retry with corrections
2. **HAPI FHIR Server Unavailability:** Primary endpoint failures affecting processing
   - **Mitigation:** Multiple FHIR endpoints, automatic failover, health monitoring
3. **Medical Coding Errors:** Incorrect or missing medical codes in resources
   - **Mitigation:** Code validation pipeline, fallback to manual coding, terminology updates
4. **Performance Degradation:** Slow bundle assembly affecting user experience
   - **Mitigation:** Async processing, caching, parallel resource creation

**Rollback Plan:**
- Cache successfully validated bundles for reference
- Fallback to simplified FHIR structure for critical cases
- Manual bundle creation tools for complex scenarios
- Database transaction rollback for failed executions
