# Epic 4: FHIR Bundle Summarization with 100% Rule-Based Processing

## Epic Goal

Convert HAPI-validated FHIR bundles into human-readable clinical summaries using comprehensive rule-based processing that achieves 100% FHIR resource coverage while maintaining clinical accuracy and consistency.

## Epic Description

**Business Value:**
This epic closes the loop on the NL-FHIR conversion process by providing clinicians with clear, consistent summaries of their FHIR bundles for verification and clinical review. The simplified architecture eliminates LLM dependency through comprehensive rule-based processing that can handle ANY FHIR bundle programmatically.

**Technical Foundation:**
- **100% Rule-Based Processing:** Comprehensive coverage with generic fallback
- **Cost-Optimized Architecture:** Zero LLM costs through programmatic processing
- **Production Monitoring:** Detailed processing analytics and quality metrics
