# Epic 4: FHIR Bundle Summarization with Adaptive Cost Optimization

## Epic Goal

Convert HAPI-validated FHIR bundles into human-readable clinical summaries using an adaptive multi-tier processing approach that minimizes LLM costs while maintaining clinical accuracy and consistency.

## Epic Description

**Business Value:**
This epic closes the loop on the NL-FHIR conversion process by providing clinicians with clear, consistent summaries of their FHIR bundles for verification and clinical review. The adaptive architecture dramatically reduces operational costs by using rule-based processing for common cases while maintaining LLM quality for complex scenarios.

**Technical Foundation:**
- **Adaptive Multi-Tier Processing:** Rule-based → Generic Template → LLM fallback
- **Cost-Optimized Architecture:** Minimize LLM usage through intelligent tier selection
- **Production Monitoring:** Automated cost tracking and alert system
- **Dynamic Resource Mapping:** Extensible rule-based summarization with self-adaptation
- **Quality Assurance:** Consistent output quality across all processing tiers

**Clinical Safety:**
Multi-tier validation ensures consistent inclusion of critical information (dosages, indications, safety considerations) while maintaining natural clinical language for human review. Rule-based processing provides deterministic handling of common clinical patterns.

## Technical Architecture

**Adaptive Multi-Tier Processing Pipeline:**
```
HAPI-Validated FHIR Bundle 
  → Bundle Analysis & Resource Classification
  → Tier 1: Rule-Based Summarizers (Target: 70-80% of cases)
  → Tier 2: Generic Template Engine (Target: 15-20% of cases) 
  → Tier 3: LLM + Instructor Fallback (Target: 5-10% of cases)
  → Clinical Summary + Monitoring Events
```

**Core Components:**

### FHIRBundleSummarizer (Primary Engine)
- **Resource Classification:** Analyzes bundle to determine resource types and complexity
- **Tier Selection Logic:** Routes to appropriate processing tier based on resource types and patterns
- **Monitoring Integration:** Tracks processing decisions and tier usage patterns
- **Quality Assurance:** Validates output consistency across all tiers

### Tier 1: Rule-Based Resource Summarizers
- **MedicationSummarizer:** Deterministic medication order processing
- **ProcedureSummarizer:** Standardized procedure summarization
- **DiagnosticSummarizer:** Lab/imaging order processing
- **ResourceSummarizer Registry:** Extensible registry for new resource types
- **Clinical Templates:** Pre-built clinical language patterns

### Tier 2: Generic Template Engine
- **Dynamic Template Selection:** Chooses templates based on resource characteristics
- **Clinical Terminology Mapping:** Standardized medical term processing
- **Template-Based Generation:** Structured output without LLM usage
- **Adaptive Learning:** Updates templates based on usage patterns

### Tier 3: LLM Integration (Fallback Only)
- **Instructor-Constrained Output:** Pydantic models ensure structured response
- **Structured LLM Service:** OpenAI integration for complex cases
- **Role-Based Prompts:** Customized for physician, nurse, or pharmacist perspectives
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of LLM failures

### Production Monitoring System
- **SummarizationEvent Tracking:** Comprehensive event logging for all processing decisions
- **Cost Analytics:** Real-time LLM usage tracking and cost projection
- **Alert Management:** Automated notifications for unusual usage patterns
- **Performance Metrics:** Response time and quality monitoring across all tiers

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Epic 3: FHIR Assembly (provides HAPI-validated FHIR bundles)

**Provides Foundation For:**
- Clinical workflow completion and order verification
- Epic 5: Infrastructure (deploys summarization components)

**External Dependencies:**
- **OpenAI API** (primary LLM service for structured output)
- **Instructor Library** (Pydantic-constrained LLM responses)
- **Pydantic v2** (structured data validation and modeling)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risks:**
1. **LLM API Dependency:** OpenAI service outages affecting summarization

2. **Structured Output Failures:** Instructor/Pydantic validation errors
   - **Mitigation:** Schema validation, error handling, graceful degradation to basic summary
3. **Clinical Accuracy Risk:** LLM generating incorrect medical information
   - **Mitigation:** Structured constraints, low temperature settings, physician review workflows
4. **Performance Risk:** LLM API latency affecting clinical workflow
   - **Mitigation:** Async processing, response caching, performance monitoring

**Rollback Plan:**
