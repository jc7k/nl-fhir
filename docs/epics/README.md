# NL-FHIR Project Epics

This directory contains formal epic documentation for the NL-FHIR (Natural Language to FHIR) project. Each epic represents a major functional area of the system and contains multiple user stories for implementation.

## Epic Overview

### [Epic 1: Input Layer & Web Interface](epic-1-input-layer.md)
**Goal:** Enable clinicians to input natural language clinical orders through a user-friendly web interface  
**Stories:** 1.1 - 1.3 (3 stories)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1  
**Key Features:** Web form, FastAPI endpoints, validation, production hardening

### [Epic 2: NLP Pipeline & Entity Extraction](epic-2-nlp-pipeline.md)  
**Goal:** Transform natural language clinical orders into structured medical entities  
**Stories:** 2.1 - 2.4 (4 stories)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 2  
**Key Features:** spaCy/medspaCy, ChromaDB, PydanticAI, medical terminology mapping

### [Epic 3: FHIR Bundle Assembly & Validation](epic-3-fhir-assembly.md)
**Goal:** Transform structured medical entities into valid FHIR R4 bundles  
**Stories:** 3.1 - 3.4 (4 stories)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 2-3  
**Key Features:** FHIR resource creation, bundle assembly, HAPI FHIR integration

### [Epic 4: Reverse Validation & Summarization](epic-4-reverse-validation.md)
**Goal:** Provide validation and human-readable summaries with clinical safety checks  
**Stories:** 4.1 - 4.4 (4 stories)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 4-5  
**Key Features:** Bundle summarization, safety validation, LLM enhancement

### [Epic 5: Infrastructure & Deployment](epic-5-infrastructure.md)
**Goal:** Deploy complete system with enterprise-grade infrastructure and operations  
**Stories:** 5.1 - 5.4 (4 stories)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 5-6  
**Key Features:** Railway deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, operational excellence

## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration:** 6 Sprints (12-24 weeks depending on sprint length)

- **Sprint 1:** Epic 1 complete (Foundation)
- **Sprint 2:** Epic 2 complete (Intelligence)  
- **Sprint 2-3:** Epic 3 complete (Interoperability)
- **Sprint 4-5:** Epic 4 complete (Safety & Validation)
- **Sprint 5-6:** Epic 5 complete (Production Operations)

## Risk Management

**Critical Risks Across All Epics:**
1. **Medical Accuracy Risk:** Incorrect clinical interpretation
2. **HIPAA Compliance Risk:** PHI exposure or audit failures
3. **Performance Risk:** Slow processing affecting clinical workflow
4. **Integration Risk:** Failures in FHIR or external system integration

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive testing including golden dataset validation
- Multi-layer validation and fallback mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization at each epic
- Security-first design with audit trails throughout

## Getting Started

1. **For Development:** Start with Epic 1, Story 1.1 for foundation setup
2. **For Architecture Review:** Review all epic documentation for system understanding
3. **For Project Management:** Use epic timelines and dependencies for sprint planning
4. **For Quality Assurance:** Reference success criteria and metrics for validation

Each epic contains detailed technical architecture, dependencies, risk mitigation, and success metrics to guide implementation and validation.
