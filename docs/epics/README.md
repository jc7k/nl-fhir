## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration:** 6 Sprints (12-24 weeks depending on sprint length)

- **Sprint 1:** Epic 1 complete (Foundation)
- **Sprint 2:** Epic 2 complete (Intelligence)  
- **Sprint 2-3:** Epic 3 complete (Interoperability)
- **Sprint 4-5:** Epic 4 complete (Safety & Validation)
- **Sprint 5-6:** Epic 5 complete (Production Operations)

## Risk Management

**Critical Risks Across All Epics:**
1. **Medical Accuracy Risk:** Incorrect clinical interpretation
2. **HIPAA Compliance Risk:** PHI exposure or audit failures
3. **Performance Risk:** Slow processing affecting clinical workflow
4. **Integration Risk:** Failures in FHIR or external system integration

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive testing including golden dataset validation
- Multi-layer validation and fallback mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization at each epic
- Security-first design with audit trails throughout

## Getting Started

1. **For Development:** Start with Epic 1, Story 1.1 for foundation setup
2. **For Architecture Review:** Review all epic documentation for system understanding
3. **For Project Management:** Use epic timelines and dependencies for sprint planning
4. **For Quality Assurance:** Reference success criteria and metrics for validation

Each epic contains detailed technical architecture, dependencies, risk mitigation, and success metrics to guide implementation and validation.
