# Epic 2.5: MedSpaCy Clinical Intelligence Integration

## Epic Goal

Upgrade the NLP pipeline from basic spaCy processing to advanced MedSpaCy clinical intelligence to achieve target F1 scores >0.75 and accuracy >93% through specialized medical entity recognition, clinical context detection, and medical safety validation.

## Epic Description

**Business Value:**
This epic addresses the critical performance gap in medical entity extraction (current F1: 0.549, target: 0.75+) by implementing MedSpaCy's specialized clinical NLP capabilities. This upgrade enables accurate detection of medical context (negation, history, hypotheticals), medication safety validation, and complex clinical entity relationships.

**Technical Foundation:**
- MedSpaCy clinical entity recognition with medical context detection
- Clinical concept normalization with RxNorm/UMLS integration  
- Advanced medical safety validation with negation/assertion detection
- Enhanced medical terminology matching with clinical abbreviations
- Context-aware medical entity relationship extraction

**Clinical Intelligence Enhancement:**
The pipeline will understand clinical context nuances like "patient denies chest pain" vs "patient has chest pain", medication histories vs current prescriptions, and hypothetical vs actual clinical scenarios.

## Current State Analysis

**Existing 4-Tier Architecture Performance:**
- **F1 Score**: 0.549 (target: 0.75+) - **36% improvement needed**
