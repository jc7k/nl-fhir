# Epic 6: FHIR R4 Critical Foundation Resources

## Epic Goal

Complete the "Critical 20" FHIR resources that deliver 80% of clinical value by implementing the 5 remaining Tier 1 resources: CarePlan, AllergyIntolerance, Immunization, Location, and Medication.

## Epic Description

**Business Value:**
This epic completes the critical foundation of FHIR resources that cover 85% of common clinical workflows. These resources are essential for patient safety, care coordination, and preventive health management. With 300% expected ROI, this represents the highest-value implementation phase.

**Technical Foundation:**
- **CarePlan:** Care coordination and treatment planning framework
- **AllergyIntolerance:** Patient safety and medication interaction alerts
- **Immunization:** Public health compliance and preventive care tracking
- **Location:** Care delivery context and resource management
- **Medication:** Drug information and formulary management

**Clinical Impact:**
These resources enable critical patient safety features including allergy alerts, drug interaction checking, care plan coordination, and immunization tracking - foundational elements for any clinical system.

- **Clinical Decision Support:** Allergy checking, drug interactions
- **Public Health Systems:** Immunization registries
- **EHR Integration:** Bidirectional care plan synchronization

## Implementation Timeline

**Target: Q4 2025 (3 months)**

### Month 1 (October 2025)
- Week 1-2: CarePlan resource development
- Week 3-4: AllergyIntolerance resource development

### Month 2 (November 2025)
