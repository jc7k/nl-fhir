# Epic 1: Input Layer & Web Interface

## Epic Goal

Enable clinicians to input natural language clinical orders through a user-friendly web interface that accepts free-text input and routes it to the NL-FHIR conversion pipeline with proper validation and error handling.

## Epic Description

**Business Value:**
This epic establishes the entry point for the entire NL-FHIR system, allowing healthcare providers to interact with the system using natural language instead of complex FHIR syntax. This dramatically reduces the learning curve and increases adoption potential.

**Technical Foundation:**
- FastAPI-based web application with HIPAA-compliant architecture
- Responsive web form interface for clinical text input
- RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access
- Production-ready infrastructure with proper security, monitoring, and deployment

**User Experience:**
Clinicians can enter orders like "Start patient John Doe on 500 mg amoxicillin twice daily" into a simple web form and receive structured FHIR bundles in return.

## Epic Stories

### 1.1 Web Form Input Interface
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (September 2025)
**Goal:** Create simple web form interface for clinical text input
**Key Features:** HTML form, patient reference field, responsive design, basic validation
**Achievements:** Full web UI operational at http://localhost:8001 with clinical text processing

### 1.2 Convert Endpoint Logic
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (September 2025)
**Goal:** Implement core /convert endpoint with processing logic
**Key Features:** Pydantic models, HIPAA logging, error handling, response formatting
**Achievements:** Enterprise-grade refactored API with 14 focused endpoint modules, 100% compatibility

### 1.3 Input Layer Production Ready
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (September 2025)
**Goal:** Production hardening of input layer components
**Key Features:** Integration testing, security hardening, Docker config, performance optimization
**Achievements:** Railway cloud deployment ready, comprehensive test suite, HAPI FHIR integration

## Success Criteria

- [x] **Clinicians can successfully input natural language orders via web form** ✅ ACHIEVED
- [x] **API endpoints accept and validate clinical text input with proper error handling** ✅ ACHIEVED
- [x] **System maintains HIPAA compliance with no PHI exposure in logs** ✅ ACHIEVED
- [x] **Response times meet <2s requirement for user experience** ✅ ACHIEVED (1.15s average)
- [x] **Production deployment is secure, monitored, and scalable** ✅ ACHIEVED (Railway deployment ready)
- [x] **Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality** ✅ ACHIEVED (422+ test cases)

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend:**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript web form
- Responsive design for desktop/mobile
- Client-side validation and error display

**Backend:**
- FastAPI application with async processing
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- HIPAA-compliant logging with surrogate identifiers
- CORS configuration for web access

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /convert` - Convert natural language to FHIR
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /` - Serve web form interface

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- None (this is the foundation epic)

**Provides Foundation For:**
- Epic 2: NLP Pipeline (receives input from convert endpoint)
- Epic 3: FHIR Assembly (uses conversion requests)
- Epic 4: Reverse Validation (uses same API patterns)
- Epic 5: Infrastructure (deploys this layer)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risks:**
1. **Security Risk:** PHI exposure in logs or error messages
   - **Mitigation:** Implement surrogate ID system, sanitize all logs
2. **Performance Risk:** Slow response times affecting user experience  
   - **Mitigation:** Async processing, response time monitoring
3. **Usability Risk:** Complex interface reducing adoption
   - **Mitigation:** Simple form design, user testing, clear error messages

**Rollback Plan:**
- Maintain separate development environment
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Database migrations are reversible
- Container-based deployment enables quick rollback

## Epic Timeline

**Sprint 1 (Epic 1 Complete)**
- Week 1-2: Stories 1.1 and 1.2 development
- Week 3: Story 1.3 production hardening
- Week 4: Integration testing and deployment

**Epic Dependencies:**
- No blocking dependencies
- Provides foundation for all subsequent epics
