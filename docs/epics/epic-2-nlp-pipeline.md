**Enhanced Data Flow:**
```
Clinical Text → Tier 1: spaCy Medical (4-10ms) → Quality Assessment
                    ↓ (insufficient quality)
                Tier 2: Transformers NER (50-200ms) → Quality Assessment  
                    ↓ (escalation rules triggered)
                Tier 3: LLM + Instructor (1500-2300ms) → Structured Output
```
