# Validated scenario: Amoxicillin with Penicillin allergy
safety_check = factory.check_medication_allergy_safety(
    medication={"name": "Amoxicillin 875mg", ...},
    patient_allergies=[{"substance": "Penicillin", "criticality": "high", ...}]
)
assert not safety_check["is_safe"]
assert len(safety_check["alerts"]) > 0
# ✅ PASS: Safety alerts generated correctly
