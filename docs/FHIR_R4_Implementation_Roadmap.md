## Executive Summary

Based on Pareto analysis of the 89 FHIR R4 resources, **20% of resources (18 resources) will deliver 80% of clinical value**. We've already implemented 17 high-value resources across 4 specialized factories. This roadmap prioritizes the remaining 72 resources by clinical impact, implementation ROI, and strategic value.

## Methodology

**Scoring Framework:**
- **Clinical Impact** (40%): Patient safety, care quality, clinical workflow improvement
- **Implementation Complexity** (25%): Development effort, dependencies, technical difficulty
- **Market Demand** (20%): Industry adoption, regulatory requirements, customer requests
- **Interoperability** (15%): Integration value, data exchange importance, ecosystem connectivity

**Score Range:** 1-10 (10 = highest priority)
