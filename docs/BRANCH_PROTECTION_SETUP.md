# üõ°Ô∏è GitHub Branch Protection Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for setting up community-friendly branch protection rules that encourage contributions while maintaining code quality for the open source NL-FHIR medical AI project.

## üéØ Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- **`main`**: Production-ready code for open source community
- **`internal-dev`**: Private development tools and proprietary elements
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for community contributions (optional)

### Feature Branches
- **`feature/*`**: Community feature development
- **`hotfix/*`**: Production fixes
- **`docs/*`**: Documentation improvements (lower barriers)

## üîß Branch Protection Rules Configuration

### Main Branch Protection

Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches** ‚Üí **Add rule** ‚Üí **Branch name pattern**: `main`

#### ‚úÖ Recommended Settings for Community Projects

**Protect matching branches:**
```yaml
‚òëÔ∏è Require a pull request before merging
  ‚òëÔ∏è Require approvals: 1-2 reviewers (not excessive for community)
  ‚òëÔ∏è Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  ‚òëÔ∏è Require review from code owners (if CODEOWNERS file exists)
  ‚òê Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
  ‚òê Require approval of the most recent reviewable push

‚òëÔ∏è Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚òëÔ∏è Require branches to be up to date before merging
  Status checks (add when CI/CD is configured):
  - ‚úÖ continuous-integration/github-actions
  - ‚úÖ test-suite
  - ‚úÖ medical-accuracy-validation
  - ‚úÖ fhir-compliance-check
  - ‚úÖ security-scan

‚òëÔ∏è Require conversation resolution before merging

‚òê Require signed commits (optional - may reduce contributions)

‚òê Require linear history (optional - may complicate community PRs)

‚òê Require deployments to succeed before merging

‚òëÔ∏è Lock branch (prevents force pushes and deletions)

‚òëÔ∏è Do not allow bypassing the above settings
  ‚òê Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
```

### Additional Branch Protections

**Internal Development Branch:**
```yaml
Branch name pattern: internal-dev
‚òëÔ∏è Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
‚òëÔ∏è Lock branch
‚òëÔ∏è Require administrators to follow these rules
```

**Documentation Branches (Lower Barrier):**
```yaml
Branch name pattern: docs/*
‚òëÔ∏è Require a pull request before merging
  ‚òëÔ∏è Require approvals: 1 reviewer
‚òëÔ∏è Allow force pushes (for documentation iteration)
‚òê Require status checks (documentation may not need CI)
```

## üè• Medical AI-Specific Considerations

### Required Status Checks

**Medical Accuracy Validation:**
- Clinical terminology validation
- Medical entity extraction accuracy tests
- FHIR compliance verification
- Drug interaction safety checks (when applicable)

**Security and Privacy:**
- HIPAA compliance validation
- PHI detection scans (should find none)
- Security vulnerability scans
- Dependency security checks

**Code Quality:**
- Python linting (ruff)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Test coverage requirements
- Medical safety code review

### Code Owners File (Optional)

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` for automatic review assignments:

```
# Global owners for medical AI safety
* @medical-team-lead @ai-safety-expert

# Medical NLP and entity extraction
/src/nl_fhir/services/nlp/ @medical-nlp-expert @clinical-reviewer

# FHIR resource generation
/src/nl_fhir/services/fhir/ @fhir-expert @healthcare-interop-lead

# Medical terminology and safety
/src/nl_fhir/models/ @clinical-terminology-expert

# Security and privacy
/src/nl_fhir/api/middleware/ @security-expert
/SECURITY.md @security-expert

# Documentation requiring medical review
/docs/MEDICAL_SAFETY.md @medical-team-lead @regulatory-expert
```

## ü§ù Community-Friendly Practices

### Encouraging Contributions

**Low-Barrier Areas:**
- Documentation improvements
- Test case additions
- Medical terminology enhancements
- Performance optimizations

**Medium-Barrier Areas:**
- New medical specialty support
- FHIR resource additions
- API endpoint enhancements

**High-Barrier Areas:**
- Core medical NLP logic
- Safety-critical components
- Security implementations

### Auto-Labeling and Triage

Configure GitHub Actions for automatic issue/PR labeling:

```yaml
# .github/labeler.yml
medical-safety:
  - docs/MEDICAL_SAFETY.md
  - src/nl_fhir/services/medical_safety/

fhir-compliance:
  - src/nl_fhir/services/fhir/
  - tests/validation/

security:
  - SECURITY.md
  - src/nl_fhir/api/middleware/security*

documentation:
  - docs/**
  - README.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md

community:
  - .github/**
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

### Required Automated Checks

**Medical AI Validation Pipeline:**
```yaml
name: Medical AI Validation
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  medical-accuracy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run medical accuracy tests
        run: uv run pytest tests/validation/ --medical-accuracy

  fhir-compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: FHIR R4 validation
        run: |
          docker-compose up -d hapi-fhir
          uv run pytest tests/fhir/ --fhir-validation

  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Security vulnerability scan
        run: |
          pip install safety bandit
          safety check
          bandit -r src/

  hipaa-compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: PHI detection scan
        run: |
          # Scan for potential PHI patterns
          uv run python scripts/phi_detection_scan.py
```

### Status Check Configuration

Enable these status checks in branch protection:
- ‚úÖ `ci/medical-accuracy`
- ‚úÖ `ci/fhir-compliance`
- ‚úÖ `ci/security-scan`
- ‚úÖ `ci/hipaa-compliance`
- ‚úÖ `ci/test-suite`
- ‚úÖ `ci/code-quality`

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these metrics to evaluate branch protection effectiveness:

- **Contribution Rate**: Number of community PRs per month
- **Review Time**: Average time from PR creation to merge
- **Quality Metrics**: Post-merge bug rate and medical accuracy
- **Community Growth**: Active contributors and issue engagement
- **Security Posture**: Vulnerability detection and resolution time

**Remember:** The goal is to balance community accessibility with medical AI safety and code quality. Adjust rules based on community feedback and project needs.
