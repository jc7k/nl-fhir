# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Healthcare Security Standards

As a healthcare interoperability tool, NL-FHIR adheres to strict security standards:

### HIPAA Compliance
- **No PHI Storage**: The application does not store any patient health information
- **Data Transit Security**: All data transmission uses TLS 1.2+ encryption
- **Access Controls**: Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance monitoring

### Medical Data Safety
- **Synthetic Data Only**: All examples and tests use synthetic medical data
- **Input Sanitization**: Protection against injection attacks in clinical text
- **Validation Pipelines**: Multi-layer validation for medical accuracy
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses that don't leak sensitive information

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously, especially in healthcare software. Please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

**For security vulnerabilities, DO NOT create a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report security issues privately:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainers (create a GitHub issue marked as "Security" with minimal details and request private communication)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: For highly sensitive issues, request PGP keys for encrypted communication

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

```
1. Vulnerability Description
   - Type of vulnerability (injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
   - Impact assessment (data exposure, privilege escalation, etc.)
   - Affected components (API endpoints, data processing, etc.)

2. Reproduction Steps
   - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
   - Sample requests/inputs (sanitized, no real PHI)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details

3. Medical Safety Impact
   - Potential impact on clinical workflows
   - Risk to patient data or care quality
   - FHIR compliance implications
   - Healthcare regulatory concerns

4. Technical Details
   - Affected code files/functions
   - Proposed fixes or mitigations
   - Severity assessment
   - Any temporary workarounds
```

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Based on severity
  - Critical (patient safety/PHI exposure): Within 1 week
  - High: Within 2 weeks
  - Medium: Within 1 month
  - Low: Next minor release
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed (coordinated disclosure)

## Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **API Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Appropriate permission levels for different user types
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout policies

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding to prevent XSS
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Secure Docker configurations
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for dependencies
- **Network Security**: Proper firewall and network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring

### Healthcare-Specific Security

#### FHIR Security
- **Bundle Validation**: Comprehensive FHIR security validation
- **Resource Access Control**: Proper FHIR resource permission handling
- **Consent Management**: Patient consent verification where applicable
- **Audit Logging**: FHIR access and modification logging

#### Medical Data Processing
- **De-identification**: Automatic removal of potential PHI
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Safe test data creation
- **Clinical Accuracy**: Validation to prevent harmful medical misinformation
- **Error Handling**: Medical-safe error responses

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Development Security
- **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Testing**: Security and penetration testing

### Medical Ethics
- **No Real PHI**: Never use real patient data in development
- **Clinical Validation**: Ensure medical accuracy in all features
- **Safety First**: Prioritize patient safety in all design decisions
- **Compliance Awareness**: Understanding of healthcare regulations

### Environment Security
- **API Key Management**: Secure handling of API keys and secrets
- **Environment Isolation**: Proper separation of dev/staging/production
- **Access Controls**: Minimal necessary permissions
- **Monitoring**: Security monitoring and alerting

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Mitigations
- **Input Sanitization**: Clinical text is sanitized before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have appropriate rate limits
- **Validation Layers**: Multiple validation steps for FHIR compliance
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage

### Areas for Enhanced Security
- **Advanced Threat Protection**: Implementation of advanced threat detection
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Enhanced verification for all components
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Anomaly detection for unusual usage patterns
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated HIPAA compliance checking

## Compliance and Certifications

### Current Status
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Designed for HIPAA compliance
- **FHIR R4 Compliance**: 100% validation success
- **Security Standards**: Following OWASP and healthcare security guidelines

### Future Certifications
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Planned for production deployment
- **HITRUST**: Healthcare industry security framework
- **FedRAMP**: For government healthcare deployments
