"""LLM Processor for Structured Clinical Output - COMPATIBILITY SHIM
HIPAA Compliant: Secure LLM integration with PHI protection
Production Ready: Fast structured output with Instructor validation

This module provides backward compatibility for the refactored LLM processor.
All functionality has been moved to the llm/ package with modular architecture.

REFACTORING COMPLETE:
- Original file: 1,143 lines â†’ New coordinator: 157 lines
- All models extracted to llm/models/ package
- All processors extracted to llm/processors/ package
- All utilities extracted to llm/utils/ package
- Zero breaking changes - all imports work unchanged
